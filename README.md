# Bgshacklett Pre-release

This tap contains formulas for useful applications which are not, yet, ready to
add to the main homebrew-core tap. The long-term goal for each of these
formulas should be to move them to the official repository once they are ready.

## How do I install these formulae?
`brew install bgshacklett/pre-release/<formula>`

Or `brew tap bgshacklett/pre-release` and then `brew install <formula>`.

## Documentation
`brew help`, `man brew` or check [Homebrew's documentation](https://docs.brew.sh).
